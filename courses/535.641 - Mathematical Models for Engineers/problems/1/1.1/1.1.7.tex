Solve the ODE by integration or by remembering a differentiation formula: 
\[ y' = cosh5.13x \]
Solution:
This problem can be solved as a basic integration with a $u$ substitution:
\[ \int{y'}\,dx = \int{cosh5.13x}\,dx \]
We can use $u = 5.13x$ and $du = 5.13dx$:
\[ y = \frac{1}{5.13}\int{coshu}\,du \]
Then:
\[ y = \frac{1}{5.13}sinhu + C \]
Replacing the $u$ term, we get our final answer:
\[ y = \frac{sinh5.13x}{5.13} + C \]
