mechanical/routing concerns
- backshell fits in location
- ensure enough tie points to maintain routed shape of harness
- ensuring enough slack near connectors for connection/disconnection
- enough clearance near connectors for hands to grasp 
- cooling keep-out-zone requirements for electrical components
- bend radii
- straight section out of connectors (heat shrink/backshell can't be bent)
- looks good in CAD, not in real-life
- enough physical space to install cable ties
- harness rubbing on sharp/metal parts, sheel metal edges, rivet/screw 
heads/tails
- ensure modeled harness matches connector drawing and connector label/callout

drawing/schematic concerns
The following are in drawing notes regarding harness performance specs
- minimum insulation resistance
- maximum wire resistance
- terminating resistor specs and test conditions (current, resistance range), location


electrical
- we use RS485 on the astronics power supply
- ARINC 809 (deutsch connectors for IFE system)
- ARINC 628 - part 5 wire design and install + part 7 - cooling guidelines
- AS/MIL-S-23190 mounting hardware

problem solving
- chroma autostacker power supply crimp repeated failure, fixed by folding over and adding
conductor material to crimp in harness assembly instructions per IPC WHMA-A-620
- ba 787 harness split modeled incorrectly to harness drawing, had to remodel and reorder
harness because the one that got ordered was too long
