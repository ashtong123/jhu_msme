CAN
STDS: 
@CAN white paper from Bosch
@ISO11898-2, high-speed CAN for road vehicles (signaling rate/bus length/# of nodes), 
physical layer

- twisted pair, connected at each end by resistor (~120ohm to match the characteristic impedance) 
form the bus
- each device connects to each wire, messages are broadcast on the bus for all to hear,
and each device filters out messages it doesn't care about
- the electrical interface is known as the 'physical layer' as opposed to the 'data link layer'
which handles logic/transmission interpretation and error checking/handling
- trade off b/w bus length and signaling rate, main limitations are cable bandwidth
and propagation delay
- has to have at least two devices, because each transmission requires an ACK signal from 
another bus device
- signals are created when devices drive a voltage difference between the two sides of 
the bus (CAN_High/CAN_Low)
- Connnector (eg: DB9, RJ10, RJ45, M12) should impedance match the bus line and terminators
- CAN does not define hardware, but some extensions (eg: CANopen) do specify hardware
- We use ITT Cannon MKJ3 series or Amphenol 803 in BA (both D38999)

ETHERNET
- RJ-45 connector
- T568A/B wire order
- Twisted pairs, shielded or unshielded 

RS232
- DB9/DB25 connectors
- Limited cable length
- Lower data rate

RS422
- Similar to 232 but with longer cable lengths and higher data rate, better noise immunity

MIL-STD-1553
- astronics equipment uses this
