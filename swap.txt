SWaP - size, weight and power

SIZE
- effective routing means shorter runs and a smaller harness
- miniaturized connectors where possible
- smallest possible wire gauge
- minimum shielding/sleeving required to meet environmental challenges

WEIGHT
- for the most part similar to size, although using less dense materials for connectors,
backshells, overmolds, shielding, etc. will reduce weight where it will not reduce size. 

POWER 
- Higher voltage achieves same power with less current. Less current also allows 
use of thinner wires, thus reducing S and W as well (Tesla 12V to 48V example). 

- Sensor payloads (use fewest and lightest possible sensors
